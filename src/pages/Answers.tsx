      Welcome visitor, I am not an AI, but a system record of Andrew. You might
      be reading this in the present, but Andrew typed this answer in the past.
      Nice to meet ya anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me give you a quick tip: those things you see on the left side of this
      page are questions that Andrew answered himself. Use that to navigate this
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      As simple as this user interface is, this is still a React application,
      coded in TypeScript. The design might be too basic for you, but trust
      meâ€”the speed at which information gets back to you is much better than
      fancy graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Works for both of us, right? I can save your time, and you can still
      consider me an application in its simplest form.
    </p>
    <p><strong>So, what brings you here?</strong></p>
